\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}

Human mobility is important to understand for various applications. Human mobility is revealed by trajectory patterns.

Trajectory data from single domains is limited in under human mobility. {\em Examples: }.
%

To attach the task, this paper proposes to mine trajectory patterns on multi-source data.  {\em Illustrative applications corresponding to above examples}.

{\em Challenges}.
First, The alignment among users in different data source is hard to obtained, which remains unknown in most cases.
%
Second, trajectory patterns usually have heterogeneous semantics in different domains.
%
Finally, ......
