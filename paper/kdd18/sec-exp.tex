\section{Experimental Study}
\label{sec-exp}

Using two real-life datasets, we conduct an extensive experimental study of , compared with the state of the art methods .


\subsection{Experimental Settings}

We first introduce the settings of our experimental study.

\stitle{Datasets}. We chose two datasets, \ie~\beijing and \shenzhen,  to test our approach.
%
Each of the two datasets consists of the road network\footnote{https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/beijing\_china/ \& https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/shenzhen\_china/} of the corresponding city in China (\ie city Beijing and city Shenzhen) and the taxi trajectory data. The trajectories of both \beijing and \shenzhen are collected in three months. Table~1 gives a summary of some statistics on the two datasets.

%\beijing Range: minlat="39.414" minlon="115.686" maxlat="40.426" maxlon="117.119", i.e., 112.5km(1.012) x 123.0(1.433)km
%road network nodes: 96406
%road network directed edges: 216153
%road network undirected edges: 129955
%total distance (km): 31528.9246597
%weakly connected component: 1465 (91223, 58, 45, ...)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Dataset Statistics Table


Each trajectory point contains: (a) a timestamp, (b) a location specified by the latitude and the longitude and (c) a driving status describing the speed and the direction. We preprocessed the two datasets by filtering out stay points and out-of-bounds points from the trajectory data and using the map matching algorithm~\cite{Newson2009MM} to derive a sequence of traveled road segments given a trajectory. The speed of each trajectory point was then assigned to the closest road segment in the matched sequence.


\stitle{Algorithms and implementation}.
Algorithms were all implemented with Java, including the state of the art algorithm  and the synthetic data generator that are available at {\small http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/\~dbl/software.php}.

All experiments were run on a PC with 2 Intel Xeon
E5--2630 2.4GHz CPUs and 64 GB of memory. The usage of virtual memory was forbidden in all our tests. When quantity measures are evaluated, the test was repeated over 5 times and the average is reported here.
