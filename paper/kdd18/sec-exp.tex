\section{Experimental Study}
\label{sec-exp}

Using two real-life datasets, we conduct an extensive experimental study of , compared with the state of the art methods .


\subsection{Experimental Settings}

We first introduce the settings of our experimental study.

\stitle{Datasets}. We chose two datasets, \ie~\beijing and \sanfan,  to test our approach.
%
Each of the two datasets consists of the road network\footnote{http://extract.bbbike.org/. The (minlat, minlon, maxlat, maxlon) are (39.414, 115.686, 40.426, 117.119) and %(37.350, -122.550, 38.000, -122.000) (sf large)
(37.705, -122.515, 37.813, -122.355) for \beijing and \sanfan, respectively.} of the corresponding city and the taxi trajectory data. The trajectories of both \beijing and \sanfan are collected in three months. Table~2 gives a summary of some dataset statistics.

Each trajectory point contains: (a) a timestamp, (b) a location specified by the latitude and the longitude and (c) a driving status describing the speed and the direction. We preprocessed the two datasets by filtering out stay points and out-of-bounds points from the trajectory data and using the map matching algorithm~\cite{Newson2009MM} to derive a sequence of traveled road segments given a trajectory. The speed of each trajectory point was then assigned to the closest road segment in the matched sequence.


\stitle{Algorithms and implementation}.
Algorithms were all implemented with Java, including the state of the art algorithm  and the synthetic data generator that are available at {\small http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/\~dbl/software.php}.

All experiments were run on a PC with 2 Intel Xeon E5--2630 2.4GHz CPUs and 64 GB of memory. The usage of virtual memory was forbidden in all our tests. When quantity measures are evaluated, the test was repeated over 5 times and the average is reported here.
