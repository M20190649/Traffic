\subsection{Traffic Flow Transmission Model}
\label{subsec-transmission}

Given the flow distribution at the current time (and possibly the total flow in the future time), predict the flow distribution after $\Delta T$ time.

Key: local transmission / time dependent / fully data-driven (i. number of time slots and ii. probability by frequency and beyond)


\subsection{Flow-based Road Speed Prediction}
\label{subsec-speed}

Speed Matrix: each row represents to a road segment and each column represents to a specific level of traffic flow. An entry of the speed matrix records the travel speed of the corresponding road at the corresponding level of traffic flow.


\stitle{Open questions}:
\bi
\item missing values
\item a mix use of flow and speed
\item the similarity between road segments and levels of traffic flow
\item flow is uneven
